# LandmarkRemark Tigerspike test

* Overview

This application collects the user name and saves their location on a map. It also updates that information 
on Firebase cloud store.

* Man Hours

I used 11 man-hours to finish this project.

* Resources

*Firebase*

I choose Firebase as a data store, as it has a lot of good documentation, very light and fast and also it is a good project.
The resources used were:
Firebase live data, the user gets updated in real time.
Off-line data, even if there is no connection, you still can see the data.

*Google Maps new API*

I used the latest resources of Google Maps API

* Issues or Limitations

As far as I can see, Firebase does not give the option to make queries with parts of the text, 
it just can compare entire values, so the query of the application uses the data that it already has.
But this is not a problem as firebase live date listener always keep the application up to date
